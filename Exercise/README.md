# Styling Divs and H3 Elements

This README provides instructions and code examples for styling divs and h3 elements using HTML and CSS.  The goal is to achieve the following effects:

1. **Hover Effect:** Divs gain a border on hover.
2. **Unique Background Colors:** Each div has a distinct background color.
3. **Custom H3 Styles:** H3 tags have customized color, size, style, and font.
4. **Enlarged Third Div:** The third div is larger than the rest.
5. **Italicized Odd H3s:** Odd-numbered h3 tags have italicized text.
